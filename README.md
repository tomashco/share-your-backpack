# Share Your Backpack

The idea of this project is to build a platform to share your backpack configuration with people around the globe.

The activity can be the most different, such as hiking 🏕️, climbing 🧗🏼‍♂️, cycling (bikepacking!) 🚵🏼‍♀️, mountaineering 🏔️ or a generic backpacking trip 🧳.

We think that sharing your gears together with the description of your trip can help other people improve and be better prepared on their next trip.

But it can be also a way to showcase your best outfits and the coolest stuff that you have! 😜
